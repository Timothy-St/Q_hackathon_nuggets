# Q_hackathon_nuqqethz

In this project, we tackle the task of efficient state preparation on cutting-edge Qiskit quantum devices. We demonstrate our approach through two examples: 
GHZ and W state preparation. You can find these demonstrations in their respective folders and notebooks.

The GHZ state preparation can be found in the 'GHZ' folder, whereas the W state preparation can be found in the W_state_report notebook.
